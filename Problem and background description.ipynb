The first-ever scientific study of the program concluded that the cameras offered no benefit at those intersections. The report also suggested those intersections might even be more dangerous because of an increase in rear-end crashes attributed to the cameras. Therefore I would like to check if the cameras seriously affected to the car accidents negatively through analysing the related datas."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem.
