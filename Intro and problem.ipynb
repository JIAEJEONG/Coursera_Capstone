If that has no positive effect on it, the majoy should install more red light cameras. \nThis data science project analyzing the relation between red light cameras and the number of car accidents may be helpful for him to decide whether the red light camera should be installed more or not. \nI would like to answer to the following question via data analysis : Have the red light cameras that had been eliminated in 2015 has a positive effect on the reduction of car accidents in Chicago ?   \n"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
